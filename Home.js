      <h1> RESTOURANT </h1>
      <p> A restaurant, or, more informally, an eatery, is a business that prepares and serves food and drinks to customers.
      [1] Meals are generally served and eaten on the premises, but many restaurants also offer take - out and food delivery services.Restaurants vary greatly in appearance and offerings, including a wide variety of cuisines and service models ranging from inexpensive fast food restaurants and cafeterias, to mid - priced family restaurants,
      to high - priced luxury establishments. < /p>

      <p > In Western countries, most mid - to high - range restaurants serve alcoholic beverages such as beer and wine.Some restaurants serve all the major meals, such as breakfast, lunch, and dinner(e.g., major fast food chains, diners, hotel restaurants, and airport restaurants).Other restaurants may serve only a single meal(
        for example, a pancake house may only serve breakfast) or they may serve two meals(e.g., lunch and dinner). < /p>

      <h1> KFC </h1>
       <p> KFC(also known as Kentucky Fried Chicken) is an American fast food restaurant chain headquartered in Louisville,
      Kentucky that specializes in fried chicken.It is the world 's second-largest restaurant chain (as measured by sales)
      after McDonald 's, with 22,621 locations globally in 150 countries as of December 2019.[5] The chain is a subsidiary of Yum!
      Brands, a restaurant company that also owns the Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and WingStreet chains.[6]

      KFC was founded by Colonel Harland Sanders, an entrepreneur who began selling fried chicken from his roadside restaurant in Corbin,
      Kentucky during the Great Depression.Sanders identified the potential of the restaurant franchising concept and the first "Kentucky Fried Chicken"
      franchise opened in Utah in 1952. KFC popularized chicken in the fast - food industry, diversifying the market by challenging the established dominance of the hamburger.By branding himself as "Colonel Sanders",
      Harland became a prominent figure of American cultural history and his image remains widely used in KFC advertising to this day.However, the company 's rapid expansion overwhelmed the aging Sanders and he sold it to a group of investors led by John Y.
      Brown Jr.and Jack C.Massey in 1964. </p>

      <h1> McDonalds </h1>
      <p>McDonald's is an American fast food company, founded in 1940 as a restaurant operated by Richard and Maurice McDonald,
       in San Bernardino, California, United States. They rechristened their business as a hamburger stand,
       and later turned the company into a franchise, with the Golden Arches logo being introduced in 1953 at a location in Phoenix,
       Arizona. In 1955, Ray Kroc, a businessman, joined the company as a franchise agent and proceeded to purchase the chain
       from the McDonald brothers. McDonald's had its previous headquarters in Oak Brook, Illinois, but moved its global
       headquarters to Chicago in June 2018.[6][7][8][9]</p>

         <h1> Pizza Hut </h1>
         <p>Pizza Hut was founded on June 15, 1958, by two brothers, Dan and Frank Carney, both Wichita State students,
         as a single location in Wichita, Kansas.[6] Six months later they opened a second outlet and within a year they
         had six Pizza Hut restaurants. The brothers began franchising in 1959. The iconic Pizza Hut building style was
         designed in 1963 by Chicago architect George Lindstrom[7] and was implemented in 1969.[8]
         PepsiCo acquired Pizza Hut in November 1977.[9][10] Twenty years later, Pizza Hut (alongside Taco Bell and
         Kentucky Fried Chicken) were spun off by PepsiCo on May 30, 1997, and all three restaurant chains became part
         of a new company named Tricon Global Restaurants, Inc. The company assumed the name of Yum! Brands on May 22, 2002</p>
